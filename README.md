# Advanced Scikit-Learn Examples 
This repo keeps some very useful but advanced features in Scikit-Learn. I extracted the code from my own project. 

## Example Python Files
CustomTransformer.py - This file demostrates how to extends Scikit-Learn API and create your own custom transformer, usually this is only required if your transformer is stateful. 

TransformerAndPipeline.py - This file shows some very useful transformer constructs like Function Transformer, Feature Union, Column Transformer, how to call your cusom transformer and how to stack the transformers to Pipeline in sequence.
